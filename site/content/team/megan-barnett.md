My name is Megan Barnett and I am the English teacher for Vive El Sueño. Originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, I graduated in May 2015 from Colorado State University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Communications and Environmental Affairs. I moved to Costa Rica after college with a desire to do something meaningful and impactful and was instantly captivated by the initiative of Vive El Sueño. I completed my TEFL degree in 2016 and have now been teaching English for a year and a half for Vive El Sueño. I am passionate about teaching and providing the students with the tools they need to successfully communicate with their clients. The Vive El Sueño English program is truly transformative and not only provides students with intensive English classes but also fosters confidence, commitment, and determination in the students. I am beyond grateful to be a part of this incredible program and cherish my time teaching the Vive El Sueño students.
