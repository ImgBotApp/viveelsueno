He works directly with the program participants to develop personalized branding and marketing material for their individual businesses. Bringing ideas to life is the main mission of Zacc and Prove Nothing, so working with the up and coming business owners of this town is a blessing and amazingly rewarding. Originally raised in Florida and North Carolina… Costa Rica became home for Zacc at the age of 24. 5 years later with friend, business partner and Henchman Matt Brown… he operates a design & marketing firm by the name of [Prove Nothing](https://provenothing.com/).
