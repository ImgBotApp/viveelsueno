Veronica Monge is the main photographer for Vive el Sueño and has an flair for finding the natural Costa Rican beauty of her country as well as capturing the colourful culture in her photos. She is feeling extremely grateful for being part of this amazing project. She had the chance to photograph all the participants and says it was a extremely humbling and inspiring process. As a professional photographer and previous owner of her own social media marketing company. She finds it to be so beautiful to see other locals evolve into their full potential! Her advice to the participants is to keep learning, stay true to yourself, be unique and never give up! Thank you to Vive el Sueno for this amazing initiative.
