Christina brings over 15 years of experience working in non-profits, advocacy, and government in the US.  In her native New York, she was the Executive Director of Cabrini Immigrant Services, a faith based non-profit that provided legal and family based services to immigrant families throughout New York City.  She specialized in working with immigrant women and youth and assisted survivors of domestic violence for legal permanent residence apart from their abusive partners.  After leaving CIS, she moved on to become the Director of Civic Engagement at the New York Immigration Coalition and was a lead organizer on pro-immigrant federal, state, and city campaigns.  She later moved on to work for two major labor unions, serving as the Deputy Political Director for RWDSU and the Legislative Coordinator for SEIU 32BJ fighting on the front lines for pro-worker legislation and policies including a successful campaign to increase New York’s minimum wage. She earned her Masters in Social Work from CUNY Hunter College and her Bachelor in Fine Arts from New York University.  Most importantly, she is madly in love with the community of Nosara, a place where she became Roland’s wife, Daphne’s mom, and Mango’s dog mom.
