### Edith Quirós Avila is a talented seamstress with a business called Creaciones Los Angeles located in Nosara, Costa Rica. Edith is a graduate of the first year of the Vive el Sueño program in 2015.

Edith has the following to share:

I always wanted to have my own business when I worked for others but couldn’t find the courage. Thanks to the Vive el Sueño program, I found the support and the courage to start my own business. Vive el Sueño opened many doors into my sewing workshop and I invite other entrepreneurs to not be discouraged despite the problems they may face. It is not easy but with goals and perseverance dreams can be achieved. Keep moving forward.

Since graduating from the Vive el Sueño program Edith has registered her business and has obtained a patent. She is now selling her designs in her store in Nosara as well as in Nativa and the Bodhi Tree Yoga Resort located in Guiones, Costa Rica. With the increased profits, Edith and her husband are now building a cabin as a property rental.
