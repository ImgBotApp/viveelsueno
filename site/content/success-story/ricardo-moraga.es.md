## [Nosara MTB & Surf](https://nosaramtbsurf.com/)

Nosara MTB & Surf is the first business ever supported by Vive El Sueño and was selected due to Ricardo’s vast experience in the tourism industry and his vision for a business that aimed to create a better Nosara. Ever since winning his first bike at a church raffle as a child in the Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica, Ricardo realized his passion for mountain biking could also be his work. Shortly after winning that bike Ricardo worked on the bike to increase its value, sold it, and bought a better one for him to train on. That same entrepreneurial spirit has made Nosara MTB & Surf a reality. Ricardo’s vision is to create a business that reduces the number of motorized vehicles on the road, reducing the environmental impact of the increased tourism in Nosara. Even in his first season up and running, his impact is visible by the number of tourists riding on rentals from his shop. Ricardo is also using his, shop, teaching background and language skills to educate the community. He currently teaches a English for the Service Industry workshop for Vive El Sueño program participants, and will be hosting free clinics on bicycle repair for workers in the area who depend on their bikes for transportation to and from work.
