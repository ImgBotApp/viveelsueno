## Creaciones Sheri

### Carmen has shared the following about her experience with Vive el Sueño.

  
Before I opened my business, I worked for 17 years at a factory that makes pants in San Jose. I moved to Nosara and worked in a business here but then I lost my job and started sewing and doing crafts such as pillows and ironing clothing. After this, I joined the Vive el Sueño program and for 2 weeks I attended the workshops focused on opening a small business. They helped me a lot and what I like the most is managing my own business.  It is going very well and I’m taking English classes now to better prepare myself so I’m able to attend to all clients without any difficulty.
