### Isabel Obando Matarrita attended and graduated from the first Vive el Sueño Small Business Workshops in September 2015. She is the owner of Panaderia Isa a bakery and pastry shop located in Nosara, Costa Rica. She offers delicious empanadas, pastries and cakes for all occasions.

Isa has graciously shared how the Vive el Sueño program has helped her.

I learned so much from the training workshops and was guided to make my business a success. The Vive el Sueño program offered me support, especially with extra publicity and they even helped me to paint my store. My advice to others wanting to start their own business is  that perseverance is what makes you grow. Continue dreaming for a better future and keep working. Your dreams can come true.

Since graduating from the Vive el Sueño program, Isa has registered her business and acquired all the necessary permits. She is now selling her baked goods in Super Nosara, the local grocery store as well as in her bakery. She was also able to send her daughter to school to study to be a pastry chef.
