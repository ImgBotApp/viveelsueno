Vive El Sueño, based in Nosara, Costa Rica, is an educational and financial empowerment program that aims to give Costa Rican nationals (Ticos) the skills, mentorship, and tools to open and sustain their own small businesses as a path to improved standards of living and financial independence.

While the boom in tourism and land development appears to have brought significant improvements in the quality of life in Nosara, recently released research shows that 25% of families still live in poverty. As recently as 2011 as many as 48% of households in Nosara and Samara still lacked at least one basic need. Our belief is that small businesses provide a much needed path to financial empowerment.

## Vive el Sueño's Goals

* Provide educational workshops on topics such as Entrepreneurship, Finance, Marketing, Management, English Classes, and Life Coaching that will both support the opening of new small businesses and increase eligibility for senior level positions in existing businesses.
* Provide ongoing mentorship to Program Participants to foster continued growth in their businesses. Connect emerging business owners to crucial resources such as grants, loans, and professional services.

## Our Program

Vive el Sueño provides local Costa Ricans wanting to open or grow their own business a 2 week / 40 hour intensive business training with the teaching group, [Yo Emprendedor](http://yoemprendedor.net/).
